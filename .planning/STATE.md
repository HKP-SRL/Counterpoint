## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Six coarse vertical slices. The build lane is proven on Cena (Phases 1–3) before design sign-off (Phase 4) and the council (Phases 5–6).
- [Roadmap]: The trust layer (sandbox, key checks, `ssh-keygen` verification, loopback guard) ships in Phase 1, before any merge path, which first appears in Phase 3.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 is CLI first. One unattended overnight run on a Cena QR-menu phase ending in a green PR is the exit gate for later phases.
- [Roadmap]: The variants / "More like B" round model is built once in Phase 4 (drafts) and reused by council cards in Phase 5.
- [Owner]: Approvals live in the host repo's normal history (research D2 rejected). The console uses Astryx. The package is `@hkp/counterpoint`.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Unverified whether Claude Code's sandbox confines headless `claude -p` (Bash and Read/Edit). This is the first spike, and the trust model depends on it.
- [Phase 2]: Unverified context-window denominator on 1M models and `rate_limit_event` shape and reset unit. Spike before the budget and limit handling.
- [Phase 3]: Branch-protection recipe for Cena's `master` not yet verified.
- [Phase 4]: Fixture-mode rendering of Cena screens and `data-cp-id` stability across redraws are unproven. Spike before the visual gate.
